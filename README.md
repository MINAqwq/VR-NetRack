# VR Netrack

**VR Netrack** is an open source application for simulating the plugging and unplugging of Server-Hardware, designed for PC with the possibly of being ported to a Standalone VR Headset.

# Brief History
This project was part of an example Project done by the **Berufskolleg Siegen** from the 18th of October, 2023 until the 29th of November, 2023. It was mostly developed by two people, with the other two serving mostly as playtesters and for writing the Documentation.

# Why it's open source now
The plan had been to open source this project all along, so future students could use it as a starting point for future VR Projects or to continue working on this program for their own projects. In the coming days we will try to put together a Wiki, to allow for proper Documentation of how to get it running on one's Computer, and what the functions do.

The reason it went public today, the 17th of January, 2024, is because the teacher we did the project under requested it.

# Documentation
For more information on how to utilize the Project, please take a look at the files inside the Documentation folder. If you choose to fork the project, and make your own, please make sure to update it's contents for future users!
