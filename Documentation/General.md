# Basics
This project was built ontop of the Unity-provided OpenXR Sample Project.

# Programs
This application was created using the following Programs. You will need these or later versions to use the project files.

## Unity 2022.3.10f1
Unity was chosen for it's compatibility with Oculus headsets, as well as thorough Documentation.

## Visual Studio 2022
Visual Studio 2022 acts as the main IDE for the creation of this Program, as it provides native compatibility with Unity.

## Blender 4.0
Blender is used to open the .blend Project files. These are then exported as .fbx into the RackObjects folder.

## Aesprite
Aesprite is used to open .ase files, which are the project files for the 2D Texture creation. Aesprite is open-source, but must be compiled from source to be used for free, otherwise it is a paid program. However, as the textures are very simple, any image editor can be used to simply edit the exported .png files directly.

## Git/GitHub Desktop
Git/GitHub Desktop was used for version control. 
More on it can found in the [Git Section](Git.md)

# Libraries
This project exclusively utilizes Unity-provided Libraries, including Unity's OpenXR Framework. Please refer to the Unity Documentation on how to use these.
