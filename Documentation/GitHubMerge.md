# Merging with GitHub
Please first take a look at [Git](Git.md).

## Merging
When a Developer finished a feature (and its working), you probably want it to be on the master branch.\
(If its a sub feature another developer needs on his branch he can just rebase on this branch)

To Merge the commits from a feature branch into the master, you first have to open a pull request (or merge request for cool people).
Go to the Tab "Pull requests" on the Repo page and click on the green "New pull request"

Then you have to select 2 branches. Left the branch you want to merge into (mostly the master branch) and right your feature branch. If everything is right click on the green "Create pull request" button. If you have the rights to do you can directly merge it into the master or ask the repo owner.
